# math-visualisation

This is a part of our tool that we built for our Final Year Btech project. Math Visualisation is one section for our project. This part contains mathematical concepts that are divided between Probability and Linear Algebra. There are total 10 topics, 4 in Probability section and 6 in Linear Algebra section. They are Monte Carlo, Uniform Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Inverse Transform Sampling and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Image Compression, Matrix Mixer, Matched Filter, Linear Transformation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aim of our project is to visualize these difficult topics that students learn in data science. GUI_Tkinter contains python code that is a software application built using the graphical user interface tkinter library in python. It shows the description of the topic, then how it is done along with its animation video. 

To access this software, download the GUI_Tkinter, Linear Algebra and Probability folders either by downloading them directly from here or by using the below command:<br/>
git clone https://github.com/finalyearProjct/math-visualisation.git

The github repository will be downloaded in your system. Then copy all the codes from Linear Algebra and Probabilities folder to the GUI_Tkinter folder and run this command from this same folder:<br/>
python main.py

The software application opens up showing the above mentioned mathematical topics. By clicking on each topic's buttons, you can see the corresponding topic's animation video and its description.
